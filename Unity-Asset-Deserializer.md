# Parsing Header Info for Unity Assets

This guide explains how to parse or deserialize Unity asset headers from a binary (hex) block.

## Minimum Meta Size and Size Ranges

Understanding the minimum meta size and their size ranges is crucial for parsing Unity asset headers. Key components include:

1. Headers of Containing Classes
2. Headers of Containing Classes Entry Offset

## Offsets Overview

The meta size offset count begins with the Unity version name (e.g., `2021.3.40f1`).

### Preceding Data Before Unity Version Name

> [!NOTE]  
> Before the Unity version name, the following information is stored:
> - Meta Size Length
> - File Size Length
> - First File Offset
> - Platform
> - Format

## Version Structure

To effectively parse headers, you need to understand the version structure, including the start, end, and endianness.

### Example: Unity 2021.3.40f1

Hereâ€™s how headers are serialized for version `2021.3.40f1`.

#### Meta Size Info Length

- **Offset**: 22 - 23 (Big Endian)

>[!Important]
> **Considerations**
> - Be aware of the minimum length size and the first class name entry offset.
> - The preceding 4 bytes before the first class name entry offset represent the total length of the classes that store that asset.
> - After the headers, add **6 null bytes** as placeholders for future header placements.
> - Class names are at the top level of headers, meaning they will be the first in the dependencies (as observed in UABE).
