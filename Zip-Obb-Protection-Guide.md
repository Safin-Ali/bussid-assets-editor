## 🔒 Modifying ZIP Headers to Protect OBB

To secure and protect the content of an OBB (which is a ZIP file), you can manipulate the ZIP headers by modifying specific blocks of data. Below are key ZIP headers and values you can alter to increase the protection of your OBB file.

### 🛠️ **How the `damageZip` Method Protects Your OBB**

The `damageZip` method automates and strengthens the protection of your OBB file by making key modifications to the ZIP headers:

1. **LFH (Local File Header) Modifications**:
    - **Nullifies CRC32** 🔒: The method sets the CRC32 checksum to null `0x0` (empty), making it difficult for ZIP utilities to verify the integrity of the file and preventing straightforward extraction.
    - **Obfuscates File Name** 📝: The first character of the file name is set to null `0x0`, which can confuse automated extraction tools or any software that relies on the name to extract files.

2. **CDFH (Central Directory File Header) Modifications**:
    - **Nullifies Version Needed to Extract** ⚙️: The version field that specifies which version of ZIP extraction software is needed is nullified for certain files, preventing standard extraction tools from working unless they are modified to handle the custom version.

3. **EOCD (End of Central Directory) Modifications**:
    - **Alters Central Directory Record Counts** 🔢: The `damageZip` method increases both the "Number of Central Directory Records" and "Total Number of Central Directory Records" by 5, misleading tools that rely on these values to navigate and extract the file.
    - **Adds Custom "Credit" Message** 💳: A fake "credit" message ("This Archive Protected By ZDamager (SA)") is inserted into the EOCD. This acts as a red herring, making it harder for automatic repair tools to parse the file.
    - **Inserts an Extra CDFH** ❓: A bogus, extra CDFH is added to the ZIP structure, confusing ZIP extraction tools that expect a specific structure.

4. **Additional Layers of Protection** 🔀:
    - **Adds Random Data**: Custom data blocks, such as the fake CDFH and the credit message, are inserted into the EOCD and other headers, preventing standard extraction tools from being able to read or repair the file without custom code.

### ⚠️ **Warning**:
- Altering these values can prevent the file from being extracted normally. Only change these fields if you understand how the structure of ZIP files works and if you are prepared to implement custom extraction logic to read the file correctly.
- Always test the modified file to ensure that you can still access it properly using your custom extraction code or tools.
