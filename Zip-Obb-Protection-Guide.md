## 🔒 How to Protect OBB by Modifying ZIP Structure

### 📂 **Modifying ZIP Headers to Protect OBB**

To secure and protect the content of an OBB (which is a ZIP file), you can manipulate the ZIP headers by modifying specific blocks of data. Below are key ZIP headers and values you can alter to increase the protection of your OBB file.

---

### 🔍 **LFH** (Local File Header)
- **CRC-32 of uncompressed data** 🛠️
    - Modify the CRC-32 value to alter the integrity check. Changing this value will prevent the file from being easily extracted or verified, making it harder for unauthorized users to access the contents.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Changing the CRC value and recalculating it for modified data prevents easy file extraction.

- **File name** 📝
    - You can also alter or obscure the file name stored in the LFH. This can make it harder to recognize the contents of the ZIP file directly.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Use obfuscated or randomized names to confuse any automated extraction or scanning tools.

---

### 🏗️ **CDFH** (Central Directory File Header)
- **Version needed to extract** ⚙️
    - Alter the version needed to extract files in the ZIP. By setting this to an unsupported or modified version, you can prevent standard unzip utilities from extracting the contents of the OBB.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Set the extraction version to a version that is not widely supported or custom-built, preventing typical decompression tools from opening the file.

### 📜 **EOCD** (End of Central Directory)
- **Number of central directory records on this disk** 🔢
    - Modify the number of directory records. By changing this number, you can mislead tools that are attempting to read or verify the ZIP structure, potentially making the file unreadable without the correct modification logic.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Randomize or change the record count to disrupt automated tools that rely on this data to read the central directory.

- **Total number of central directory records** 🔢
    - Adjust the total number of directory records to further distort the structure. This is another layer of protection, making the file harder to process correctly by standard ZIP extraction tools.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Modify the total record count to break tools that don't expect the directory to be tampered with.

- **Add Credit** 💳
    - Introduce a custom value or "credit" (i.e., a fake or unused record) to confuse attempts to process the ZIP file. This could be a custom block of data that doesn't conform to typical ZIP formats.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Add random or custom data to disrupt attempts to analyze the ZIP file's internal structure.

- **Add Another Unknown CDFH** ❓
    - Add an additional CDFH (Central Directory File Header) that does not match the expected structure. This will cause confusion for any extractor trying to parse the file.
    - 🛡️ **Protection Tip**: Insert an unknown or bogus CDFH at the end to prevent automated extraction tools from working, as they will expect one valid CDFH.

---

### ⚠️ **Warning**:
- Altering these values can prevent the file from being extracted normally. Only change these fields if you understand how the structure of ZIP files works and if you are prepared to implement custom extraction logic to read the file correctly.
- Always test the modified file to ensure that you can still access it properly using your custom extraction code or tools.

---

### 🛠️ **Tools for Modifying ZIP Files**
- Use tools like **Hex Editors** to manually alter the binary values of ZIP headers.
- You can also write custom code in languages like **Python** or **JavaScript** to modify the ZIP structure programmatically.
- **7-Zip** and **WinRAR** can sometimes be used to manipulate and protect ZIP files, although they don't provide direct control over the internal header values.

### 💡 **Recommendation**:
- For higher security, combine these structural modifications with strong encryption or password protection, if needed.
- Always test with different ZIP extraction tools to ensure that your changes provide the desired level of protection while maintaining usability.
